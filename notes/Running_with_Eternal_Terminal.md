# Running With Eternal Terminal

Eternal Terminal is a terminal that supports ssh-tunnels. This is useful when you are using Berkeley's LNL cluster, and can only log into the cluster log-in mode using 2-factor authentication and SSH. 

Because you can not use a public key to automatically sign-in automatically, you should setup an ssh-tunnel as a persistent port-forwarding connection from your local machine to remote machine.

Eternal Terminal makes this easy. Documentation on Eternal Terminal can be found here: https://github.com/MisterTea/EternalTerminal

Now, **install eternal terminal** by running `brew install MisterTea/et/et` (for Ubuntu please refer to the doc).
